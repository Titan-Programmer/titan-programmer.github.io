# For Contributors
Welcome to the student blog for the Bertelsmann Tech Scholarship Phase 1.

# What Is the Purpose of This Blog?
The blog was created to help all students practice their Git, GitHub skills and consolidate the knowledge they have learnt.

# Can I Add to This Blog?
Yes, of course. The blogs purpose is for students to fork the repository, make changes in the required areas, commit them and make a pull request which the repository owner will review. These changes will be visible on the website once accepted.

# Where Can I Make Changes?
Every student can make changes to the 3 tabs of 'Learning Git', 'Exploring AWS', 'Implementing CloudFormation' and on the 'Student Blogs' page.

# What Can These Changes Be?
The 3 tabs next to the home tab are based on the 3 main topics taught in Phase 1. Each tab contains a question which you can add a comment to. You can make similar changes to the Student Blog page where you can add a comment containing a link and quick summary for your blog (See Blog Challenge).

# What Is the Comment Format?
You will notice I have already made multiple comments in the tabs using a particular format and I kindly request all contributors to use this format. If you do not wish to include your name, then please state Anonymous.

# Can I Implement Different Changes to The Blog?
All change requests beyond the stated areas to the blog will be considered. Therefore, please feel free to challenge yourself. If you have already made the change and pull request, then please ensure a comment is left explaining the changes made.
